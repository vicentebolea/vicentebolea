## What I do

I do many interesting things, but, from a technical point of view it might not be that much profitable. Jokes apart, I have a strong expertise from inside Academia and Industry in the areas of Software Engineering, specifically Big Data Systems and UNIX systems. Things I can do for you are:

    Assess on ideas in that domain
    Develop solutions for complex problems
    Contribute with knowledgeable ideas


Very importantly, I do all these things for free, but only if the software is OSS and I am interested on it. If we are talking about a commercial or boring product, my suffering shall be compensate.
